# ProcessGAN: Generating Privacy-Preserving Time-Aware Process Data with Conditional GANs 
This repository is the implementation of the ProcessGAN model, a synthetic process data generator using GAN-based network. 

Process data constructed from event logs provides valuable insights into how processes unfold over time. 
Because process data with confidential information cannot be shared, 
research is limited using process data and analytics in the process mining domain. 
We introduced a synthetic process data generation task to address the limitation of sharable process data. 
We introduced a generative adversarial network, called ProcessGAN, 
to generate process data with activity sequences and corresponding timestamps. 
Our ProcessGAN model can generate process data from random noise, which can preserve the privacy and augment the datasaet.

## üóí Model Description
- **Model type:** A transformer encoder as generator, and a time-based self-attention model as discriminator.
- **Training data:** Process data (event logs) that contains sequence of activities, and the corresponding timestamps.
- **Evaluation approach:** We trained an off-the-shelf model to score the synthetic sequences. We also used different statistical metrics to evaluate the performance.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
* Python 3.10
* pytorch==1.13.1
* numpy==1.26.4
* matplotlib
* pandas
* pyyaml
* seaborn
* editdistance

### Usage

Preliminaries:

Adjust the configurations/sepsis_trans.yaml and sepsis_trans_attn.yaml files


Data preparation:

python utils/create_input_files.py --data bpic2012_a --num 3748 --caseID Case\ ID --activity Activity --starttime time:timestamp


Training and generation:

python run.py --data bpic2012_a

#### Data preparation 
To preprocess the dataset:
```bash
python utils/create_input_files.py --data [DATASET] --num [NUM] --caseID [CASE ID] --activity [ACTIVITY] --starttime [TIMESTAMP]
```


**Arguments**

	‚Ä¢	--data: The name of the dataset (without the .csv extension). This file should be placed in the data/data_raw/ folder. For example, if you have data/data_raw/sepsis.csv, you would pass --data sepsis.
	‚Ä¢	--num: A number related to the cases, though this argument is currently unused by the script.
	‚Ä¢	--caseID: The column name in the CSV file that identifies unique cases.
	‚Ä¢	--activity: The column name in the CSV file that represents the activity.
	‚Ä¢	--starttime: The column name in the CSV file that contains timestamps.

**Note**: if you encounter issues, try to delete the already existing txt and csv files and generate new ones with the command above.


#### Training 
**IMPORTANT**  Each experiment (combination of model and dataset) requires a configuration file located in the configurations/ folder. Ensure that you modify the configuration file to suit your specific experiment setup.

To train our model and test the performance:
```bash
python run.py --mode [MODE] --model [MODEL] --data [DATASET]
```
_**--mode [MODE]**_: Choose a training mode based on different loss values to add.

Replace [MODE] with a training mode. 

'vanilla': Vanilla ProcessGAN without auxillary losses.

'act_loss': ProcessGAN with activity-based loss.

'time_loss': ProcessGAN with time-based loss.

'act_time_loss': ProcessGAN with both auxillary losses.

_**--model [MODEL]**_: Choose from different discriminator model.

Replace [MODEL] between "trans_attn" and "trans".

"trans_attn": Our ProcessGAN model with transformer-based generator and time-based discriminator.

"trans": Baseline GAN model using transformer-encoder as both generator and discriminator.

_**--data [DATASET]**_: Select a dataset to train.

Replace [DATASET] with "SEP" or "BPI", which is the [public sepsis process dataset](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/Sepsis_Cases_-_Event_Log/12707639), or [public BPI dataset](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/BPI_Challenge_2012/12689204).

#### üîç Evaluation

The evaluation solutions are implemented in 'eval/'. We used four statistical metrics to evaluate the synthetic process:
- Sequence length
- Sequence variance 
- Activity type error
- Activity timestamp error

The statistical evaluation will be automatically generated at every 100 epoch.

To train the off-the-shelf classifier, run _off_the_shelf_classifier_time.py_ under 'eval/' folder.
